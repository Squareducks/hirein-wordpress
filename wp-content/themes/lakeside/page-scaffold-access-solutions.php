                            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Always ensure your scaffold tower is erected by a competent person and use necessary safety accessories like <a href="<?php echo home_url('/scaffold-tower-scaff-tag-hire/'); ?>">Scaff Tags</a> and <a href="<?php echo home_url('/scaffold-tower-accessories/'); ?>">stabilisers</a>.</li>
